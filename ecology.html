	<h2> Introduction to Ecology </h2>
	<p> Ecology is a branch of biology which studies the interactions among organisms and their environment. Objects of study include interactions of organisms with each other and the components of their environment. This basically means that eology is the study of the relationships between living things and their surroundings, or environment. People who work in ecology are called ecologists. Ecologists examine how living things depend on one another for survival. They also study how living things use such natural resources as air, soil, and water to stay alive. <p> </p> Ecology is important because it shows how changes in the environment affect the survival of living things. For example, when pollution kills certain living things, the animals that feed on them also may die. The work of ecologists has convinced many people to conserve, or protect, the environment and all the ecosystems that it supports. </p>
	<h2> Ecology in ITB</h2>
	<p> The Institude of Technology Blancharstown is very important amenity resource for the local communties but also provides habitats for many species of floa and fauna. Buzzards and other predators visit the rough grassland areas to hunt. The abdundant vegetation of these meadows provides the ideal habitat for rabbits.  </p>

	<li>In the first picture there is a picture of a type of grass found on the campus in ITB called Rhinanthus minor (yellow ratlle flowers) Yellow Rattle is a well-known wildflower commonly found in meadows, grassy places, heaths and machair.  It produces loose, leafy spikes of flowers, usually yellow but occasionally brownish, from May to September.  The flowers (13-15mm long) are 2-lipped corollas which have blue or violet teeth and are open-mouthed.  The leaves are oblong with rounded teeth, are unstalked and opposite.  The seeds are formed inside inflated, dry capsules which, when ripe, rattle and eventually release the seeds to the wind.</p> </li>

	<li> In the second picture there is a type of grass also found on the campus of ITB called Myostis arvensis. Its slightly cup shaped pale blue 5-petalled flowers (3-4mm across), with a yellow centre, are born in cymes which uncurl as the flowers open, from April to September. The leaves are oblong and pointed and both these and the stems are extremely hairy.  The basal leaves form a rosette.It is annual plant, it grows to 25cm high.
