<p1>Institute of Technology Blanchardstown was established in 1999 and is a third level institution. ITB provides part-time and full-time courses in higher education in a wide range of courses. In January 2019 ITB will join the Institute of Technology Tallaght (ITT) and Dublin Institute of Technology (DIT) to form ‘Technological University of Dublin” (TUD).It will be Irelands eight University but Irelands first technological University. In the first picture this it the Institude of Technology when it was first bulit in 1999. The second picture of the Institude of Technology campus was taken in 2012. As you can see the campus has come along way since then. </p1>

	<p2> When the college first opened it is what us students now would know as "A block". ITB had the same logo from 1999 to 2006! Alot of politicans were involved in the establishment of ITB. The reason everyone picked this loaction for the campus was the access to blancharstown shopping centre and the diffrent bus routes. 2004 was the year people started to pay more attention to the potential the Insitude of Technology had. The ITB logo was designed by the same people that designed the badges 'Ta" for the equal marriage refrendum.' </p2>
